# Industry-Equipment-Detection-with-Yolov7


## Overview
This repository contains a project that utilizes the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify and classify construction equipment in images and videos. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient system for detecting various types of construction machinery, enhancing safety and operational efficiency on construction sites.

## Features
State-of-the-art Object Detection: Leveraging the advanced capabilities of YOLOv7, the model achieves high accuracy and speed in detecting construction equipment.
Real-time Detection: Optimized for real-time processing, enabling on-the-fly detection and monitoring of equipment.
Custom Training: Includes scripts and guidelines for training the model on custom datasets, allowing for adaptation to specific requirements and environments.
Comprehensive Dataset: Provides a well-annotated dataset of various construction equipment types, including excavators, bulldozers, cranes, and more.
User-friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive interface for loading images and videos, running the detection model, and visualizing the results.
Deployment Ready: Easily deployable on edge devices and cloud platforms, making it suitable for integration into existing construction management systems.
